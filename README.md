# react-kickstart
A basic ReactJS project. This was made to save time setting up react-router, webpack, babel, less, etc. Credit to Tyler McGinnis and his excellent [React Fundamentals course](https://github.com/ReactjsProgram/React-Fundamentals). This is essentially a modified version of one of the branches from his course.
